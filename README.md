# MY GPT

This repo started by me Following Adrej's tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY).
I followed the steps to create a decoder only network to produce text after being trained on the lord of the rings books.  
Following this I am trying to implement a translator that incorporates the decoder and encoder side of the equation.
